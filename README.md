## <a name="Outline">Outline</a>

Build a small takeaway program in Ruby!

## <a name="Task">The Task</a>

This challenge starts with going over the foundational skills from this week's Oystercard challenge and then introduces some additinal complexities with the use of the Twilio API.

## <a name="Installation">Installation Instructions</a>

1. Clone the repo to your local machine
2. Run the command `gem install bundle` (if you don't have bundle already)
3. When the installation completes, run `bundle`
4. Run the programme in IRB, requiring the takeaway.rb file in the lib directory
5. Tests can be run using Rspec

## <a name="Story">User Stories</a>

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices
```

```
As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes
```

```
As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order
```

```
As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```

Unfortunately I did not get to complete this challenge. Next up was using the Extract Class methodology to create a JourneyLog class from Journey, and use it to un-couple some of the more coupled features of the program.
